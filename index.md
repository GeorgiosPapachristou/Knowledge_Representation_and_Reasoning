### About Me

I am an experienced Senior Internal Control and Compliance Officer at an International Organization with more than 12 years of working experience. I hold a PhD in Accounting and I am currenlty studying at the University of Essex Online.

### Artefacts

*   Unit 1

    Introduction to Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

    This unit provided an introduction to knowledge representation and reasoning and introduced common definitions of the terms. Relevant activities with regards to these concepts can be seen in the link below.
    
*   Units 1-3

    Discussion Forum 1

    During these units, a discussion over the assertion that "Knowledge Representation is a recent phenomenon – it only became a topic of discussion with the development of computing technology and the need to represent knowledge in computer systems" took place. In the link below evidence of this discussion can be seen.

*   Unit 3

    Introduction to Reasoning

    During this unit the concept of reasoning was discussed as well as some formal methods of reasoning as the building blocks for knowledge representation and reasoning. Relevant activities can be seen in the link below.

*   Unit 5
  
    Introduction to Modelling

    In this unit, it was discussed the meaning of knowledge modelling and engineering and explored the principles of knowledge engineering. Relevant activities can be seen in the link below.

*   Unit 6

    Introduction to Ontology Building and Online and Offline Tools
  
    In this unit, i learnt how to use knowledge representation and reasoning tools to design a knowledge-based solution, and i prectised the application of Protégé to develop simple knowledge-based systems. Relevant activities can be seen in the link below.

*   Unit 7 Knowledge Elicitation and Formalism
  
    During this unit, the concepts of and principles that underpin knowledge acquisition were explored, the approaches to knowledge acquisition were discussed as well as the formalism within the context of knowledge representation reasoning. Relevant activities can be seen in the link below.

    [Collaborative Discussion 3](https://github.com/GeorgiosPapachristou/Intelligent_Agents/blob/91788b31796334f1895f33000950666a3c89bfe8/Discussion%20Forum%203.pdf)
  
*   Unit 8
  
    Modelling with Protégé

    In this unit, i learnt how to apply a systematic approach to explore and understand data, how to use the Protégé software tool to explore data and develop, and also techniques to extract knowledge for representation. Relevant activities can be seen in the link below.

*   Units 9-11

    Discussion Forum 2

    During these units, a discussion over the definition of ontology and the language (KIF, OWL2, RDF, OWL-Lite) that is the most useful to express ontologies that can be utilised by software agents on the WWW took place. In the link below evidence of this discussion can be seen.

*   Unit 11
  
    Knowledge-based Technologies and Emerging Applications

    During this unit, emerging approaches to developing ontology and knowledge-based systems were discussed, the concept of multi-domain ontology was presented, and various initiatives and the role of ontology in building Knowledge-based systems were explored. As part of this unit, I was tasked with employing the Protégé software to construct a prototype ontology as the backbone for an AI-driven job-matching service. In the link below evidence of this activity can be seen.

*   Unit 12

    Ontology Evaluation – Case Study

    During this unit, the development choices and decisions that need to be made when developing an ontology were presented, some of the emerging methodologies and how they are applied were discussed, and the various evaluation approaches to ensuring a fit for purpose knowledge-based system were explored. As pasr of this unit, I was requested to provide my personal reflections about the module. In the link below evidence of this activity can be seen.
