### Artefacts

*   Unit 1

    Introduction to Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

    This unit provided an introduction to knowledge representation and reasoning and introduced common definitions of the terms. Relevant activities with regards to these concepts can be seen in the link below.
    
*   Units 1-3

    Discussion Forum 1

    During these units, a discussion over the assertion that "Knowledge Representation is a recent phenomenon – it only became a topic of discussion with the development of computing technology and the need to represent knowledge in computer systems" took place. In the link below evidence of this discussion can be seen.

*   Unit 3

    Introduction to Reasoning

    During this unit the concept of reasoning was discussed as well as some formal methods of reasoning as the building blocks for knowledge representation and reasoning. Relevant activities can be seen in the link below.

*   Unit 5
  
    Introduction to Modelling

    In this unit, it was discussed the meaning of knowledge modelling and engineering and explored the principles of knowledge engineering. Relevant activities can be seen in the link below.

*   Unit 6

    Introduction to Ontology Building and Online and Offline Tools
  
    In this unit, i learnt how to use knowledge representation and reasoning tools to design a knowledge-based solution, and i prectised the application of Protégé to develop simple knowledge-based systems. Relevant activities can be seen in the link below.

*   Unit 7 Knowledge Elicitation and Formalism
  
    During this unit, the concepts of and principles that underpin knowledge acquisition were explored, the approaches to knowledge acquisition were discussed as well as the formalism within the context of knowledge representation reasoning. Relevant activities can be seen in the link below.

    [Collaborative Discussion 3](https://github.com/GeorgiosPapachristou/Intelligent_Agents/blob/91788b31796334f1895f33000950666a3c89bfe8/Discussion%20Forum%203.pdf)
  
*   Unit 10
  
    Deep Learning in Action

    In this unit, emerging applications of deep learning were presented, the potential social and ethical issues associated with these technologies were discussed, and the future directions of these technologies were explored. In the link below, an overview of self-driving cars, a brief synopsis of how they work, and their potential impacts in terms of ethics, privacy, social good, or any other socio-technical aspects can be seen.

*   Unit 11

    Intelligent Agents in Action

    In this unit, the concept of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing was introduced, the concept of a smart shop floor and the associated issues were discussed, and the the use of agent-based modelling in the financial sector was investigated. During this unit an Academic Research Online Agent was developed based on the design reported prepared during Unit 6. In the links below, the presentation summarizing the development of the agent as well as the transcript of the presentation can be seen.

*   Unit 12
  
    The Future of Intelligent Agents

    During this unit, the future directions of intelligent technologies were explored, the potential ramifications of these developments were discussed, and how technology will evolve in the coming years was considered. In the link below, personal reflections oven the entirety of this module can be seen.
